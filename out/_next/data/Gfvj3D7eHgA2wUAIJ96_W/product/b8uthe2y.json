It produces fruit year-round and accounts for 80% of cultivated avocados in the world.[21][55] All 'Hass' trees are descended from a single 'mother tree' raised by a mail carrier named Rudolph Hass, of La Habra Heights, California.[20][55] Hass patented the productive tree in 1935. The 'mother tree', of uncertain subspecies, died of root rot and was cut down in September 2002.[21][55][56] 'Hass' trees have medium-sized (150–250 g or 5.3–8.8 oz), ovate fruit with a black, pebbled skin. The flesh has a nutty, rich flavor with 19% oil. A hybrid Guatemalan type can withstand temperatures to −1 °C (30 °F)","shape":"Oval","hardiness":"−1 °C","taste":"Gorgeous, is an avocado"}}},"__N_SSG":true}
